You can create reactive values that depend on asynchronous calls with `useAsync`.

On the server, this helper will inline the result of the async call in your HTML and automatically inject them into your client code. Much like `asyncData`, it _won't_ re-run these async calls client-side.

However, if the call hasn't been carried out on SSR (such as if you have navigated to the page after initial load), it returns a `null` ref that is filled with the result of the async call when it resol

The `$http` here has been taken from the [`@nuxt/http` module](https://http.nuxtjs.org/). In order for this example to work, you need to install it (`yarn add @nuxt/http`/`npm install @nuxt/http`) and add it to your `nuxt.config.js` modules list. 

```ts
import { defineComponent, useAsync, useContext } from '@nuxtjs/composition-api'

export default defineComponent({
  setup() {
    const { $http } = useContext()
    const posts = useAsync(() => $http.$get('/api/posts'))

    return { posts }
  },
})
```

:::alert
At the moment, `useAsync` is only suitable for one-offs, unless you provide your own unique key. [More information](/getting-started/gotchas#keyed-functions).
