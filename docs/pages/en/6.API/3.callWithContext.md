title: callWithContext
description: 'Ensures Context will always be available inside called Composable'
---

This function equals one of Nuxt Bridge/Nuxt 3 internals: `callWithNuxt`. 
It accepts `useContext()` response as first argument, function-to-call as second and function's arguments as third.
When you call this function, you can always be sure that function-to-call will have access to `useContext`, `useRoute`, e.t.c. methods.

Example of usage with useAsync:
```ts
import { defineComponent, useContext, callWithContext } from '@nuxtjs/composition-api'
import { useMyComposable, useSecondComposable } from '../composables'

export default defineComponent({
  setup() {
      const context = useContext()

      useAsync(async () => {
          try {
              //Context is lost after you call first await on SSR
              const firstAwait = await useMyComposable({ option: true })
              //This one depends on firstAwait and calls useContext inside of it
              const secondAwait = await callWithContext(context, useSecondComposable, [{ option: true }])

              return {
                  firstAwait,
                  secondAwait,
              }
          }
          catch (e) {
              //Wait for logging system response etc
              await callWithContext(context, useProcessError, [{ error: e }])
              throw e
          }
      })
  },
})
```

:::alert{type="info"}
Note: after first call of useContext on Client Side context will be stored as global. You will not have to call function to access returned in setup composables on client side.
