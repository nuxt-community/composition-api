title: useMeta
description: 'You can define your head and meta properties with the Nuxt Composition API.'

You can interact directly with [head properties](https://nuxtjs.org/api/pages-head/) in `setup` (and within the `onGlobalSetup` method) by means of the `useMeta()` helper.

:::alert
Make sure that you use `defineComponent` exported from `@nuxtjs/composition-api`, otherwise `useMeta` won't work
:::

```ts
import { defineComponent, useMeta, computed, ref } from '@nuxtjs/composition-api'

export default defineComponent({
  // You need to define an empty head to activate this functionality
  head: {},
  setup() {
    // This will allow you to set the title in head - but won't allow you to read its state outside of this component.
    const { title } = useMeta()
    title.value = 'My page'

    // You could also provide an initial value.
    const { title } = useMeta({ title: 'My page' })

    // ... or simply set some meta tags
    useMeta({ title: 'My page', ... })

    // You can even pass a function to achieve a computed meta
    const message = ref('')
    useMeta(() => ({ title: message.value }))
  },
})
```
