:::alert{type="info"}
Nuxt Bridge has now been released in beta. It's strongly recommended to migrate _instead_ to Nuxt Bridge by following the steps in [the Bridge migration guide](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/bridge/). Make sure to read the [specific migration guide](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/bridge-composition-api) on how to replace composables from `@nuxtjs/composition-api` with the new Nuxt 3-compatible composables provided by Bridge.
