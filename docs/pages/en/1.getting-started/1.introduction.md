> `@nuxtjs/composition-api` provides a way to use the Vue 3 Composition API in with Nuxt-specific features.

**Note**: the main aim is to allow experimentation and feedback before the final release of Nuxt 3. The API of Nuxt-specific methods will likely change before Nuxt 3 is released.

## Key features
