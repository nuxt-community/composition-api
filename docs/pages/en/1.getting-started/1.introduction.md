> `@nuxtjs/composition-api` provides a way to use the Vue 3 Composition API in with Nuxt-specific features.

:::alert{type="info"}
**Nuxt Bridge has now been released in beta.** It has full composition API support and it's strongly recommended to use Nuxt Bridge _instead_, if possible, by following the steps in [the Bridge migration guide](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/bridge/). Feedback welcome at `https://github.com/nuxt-community/composition-api/discussions/585`.

## Key features

:::list{type="primary"}

- Support for the new Nuxt fetch in v2.12+
- Easy access to router, app, store within setup()
- Interact directly with your vue-meta properties within setup()
- Drop-in replacement for ref with automatic SSR stringification and hydration (ssrRef)
- Written in TypeScript
- Use `script setup` (automatically configured using [`unplugin-vue2-script-setup`](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-vue2-script-setup))
